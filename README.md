# Laravel — React Application with Passport, Redux, and Material UI (Backend)  

I this project, shall be building a fullstack application (frontend and backend) using Laravel and React. I will focus more on the security architecture (authentication and authorization). For the backend authentication, I will be using Passport for authentication. There are other methods of authentication you can use to secure your API in Laravel. We have:

### Authentication methods
1.JWT (I wrote a tutorial on this, you can check it out here )
2.Laravel Sanctum
3.Laravel Authentication — Built in Laravel Authentication
4.Laravel Socialite.

### Application Structure
The application will be divided into two. 
    The backend where i will design our API and the frontend where i  will design the User interface etc Hence, thr application will be structured as follows.

 1 .Backend — Containing our Laravel application for developing the API (we will work on this in this first part of the tutorial)
 
 2 .Frontend — Containing our React — Redux Application
